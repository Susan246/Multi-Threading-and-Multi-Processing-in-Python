The concept is similar to thread synchronization, but it is designed to work with processes instead of threads. This is useful when you need to coordinate multiple processes, such as in parallel computations or when processes depend on each other to complete a task before continuing.\n","\n","### Methods and Attributes of multiprocessing.Barrier:\n","#### i. wait(timeout=None):\n","- Purpose: Used by processes to wait at the barrier.\n","- How It Works: When a process calls barrier.wait(), it blocks until all participating processes have also called wait(). Once all processes have called wait(), the barrier is released, and all processes can proceed with their execution.\n","- Timeout: The timeout parameter allows the process to wait for a specific time before raising a TimeoutError if not all processes reach the barrier.\n","#### ii. abort():\n","- Purpose: Used to abort the barrier and reset its state.\n","- How It Works: If a process needs to stop the barrier prematurely, it can call barrier.abort(). This will cause the barrier to reset, and any process that subsequently calls wait() will raise a BrokenBarrierError, signaling that the barrier was aborted.\n","#### iii. n_waiting:\n","- Purpose: Provides the number of processes currently waiting at the barrier.\n","- How It Works: This attribute can be used to check how many processes are waiting to synchronize at the barrier before they can all proceed.\n","#### iv. parties:\n","- Purpose: Returns the total number of processes that need to reach the barrier before it is released.\n","- How It Works: This attribute indicates how many processes must call wait() before the barrier is triggered. It is set when the barrier is initialized and is usually the same number for all participating processes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"139f253f-a034-479e-a295-4932babc4741","metadata":{"id":"139f253f-a034-479e-a295-4932babc4741"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4ff028f0-2347-42cc-8bd5-ad591dc37af1","metadata":{"id":"4ff028f0-2347-42cc-8bd5-ad591dc37af1"},"source":["## Scenario:\n","- We have four players playing a game.
