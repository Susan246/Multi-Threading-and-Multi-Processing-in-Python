    "- Semaphore starts with a fixed number of tickets (e.g., 3).\n",

    "- Once the semaphore reaches 0, no more processes can acquire a ticket. They must wait until a ticket is released.\n",
    "- After a process finishes using the resource, it releases a ticket. The counter increases by 1 for each release.\n",
    "- If a process tries to release more tickets than the initial limit (3), the semaphore will not allow it, and the ticket count will remain within the initial limit."

    "## How semaphore eliminate race condition for process?\n",
    "### What Semaphore Can Do:\n",
    "- Control access: Semaphore allows multiple processes to access a shared resource concurrently, but it limits the number of processes that can access the resource at any given time.\n",
    "- Concurrency management: By limiting the number of processes, it can prevent the system from being overwhelmed by too many processes trying to access a resource simultaneously.\n",
    "### What Semaphore Cannot Do:\n",
    "- Prevent race conditions: Semaphore by itself does not guarantee that multiple processes won't modify shared data concurrently, leading to race conditions. Multiple processes can still access and modify shared data simultaneously unless mutual exclusion (via locks) is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eliminating Race Conditions with Semaphore + Lock\n",
    "To eliminate race conditions while using semaphores, semaphores control the concurrency (how many processes can access a resource), and locks (like Lock) ensure mutual exclusion when processes modify the shared resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semaphore: Controls how many processes can access the critical section at a time.\n",
    "- Lock: Ensures that only one process can modify the shared resource at a time, thus preventing race conditions."
