    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DataProcessingThread class extends threading.Thread and overrides the run() method to handle the data processing logic.\n",
    "- We catch exceptions inside the run() method. If an exception occurs, it’s stored in the self.error attribute and printed out, allowing us to handle errors more specifically for each user’s task.\n",
    "### Proper Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each thread can now independently catch and store its own error. If an error occurs, it is handled within the thread and reported immediately.\n",
    "- The main thread can check the error attribute of each thread after they join and print a more detailed report of the error.\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Centralized Error Handling: Each thread can handle its errors independently, without affecting the other threads. It provides detailed information about the error for each task.\n",
    "- Easy Reporting: The main thread can gather error details for each task, making it easier to log and handle errors across multiple threads.\n"

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- When using a normal threading approach without a class, the task logic is tightly coupled with the main thread execution, making it harder to extend or reuse. If new tasks are introduced, the functions need to be rewritten or duplicated, resulting in redundant and unmaintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By extending the Thread class, we encapsulate task-specific logic within the class, making it reusable and extensible. Adding new tasks only requires modifying or adding methods within the class, without impacting the main thread logic.\n",

    "### Benefits of Extending the Thread Class:\n",
    "- Code Organization: Task logic is encapsulated within the class, improving code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reusability: The same class can be reused for multiple tasks with minimal changes.\n",
