    "# Barrier Objects:\n",
    "- A Barrier is a synchronization primitive in Python used to synchronize multiple threads at a certain point in their execution. All threads involved in the barrier must call the wait() method to indicate that they have reached the synchronization point. Once all threads have called wait(), they are all released to continue execution."
