    "- You can cancel the timer before it executes using cancel() if needed."

    "### Why we need start():\n",
    "- Trigger Timer Execution: The start() method is necessary to begin the countdown for the scheduled task. Without calling start(), the timer won't start, and the function will not be executed after the specified interval.\n",
    "- Asynchronous Execution: It starts the timer in a new thread, allowing the main program to continue running while waiting for the timer to execute the function after the given interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we need cancel():\n",
    "- Interrupt Timer Execution: The cancel() method is used to stop the timer before it executes the scheduled function. If the timer hasn't yet expired (i.e., the function hasn't been executed), calling cancel() will prevent the function from running.\n",
    "- Flexibility in Scheduling: It allows flexibility, so you can dynamically cancel scheduled tasks. This is useful when the conditions for executing the function change, or you decide that the function should no longer be executed."
