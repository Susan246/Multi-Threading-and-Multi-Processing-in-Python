    "### Types of Task:\n",
    "1. CPU-bound Tasks:\n",
    "- Definition: CPU-bound tasks are those that primarily require significant processor power to perform computations. These tasks are limited by the processing speed of the CPU.\n",
    "- Examples: Complex mathematical computations (e.g., prime number calculation, image processing, data encryption).\n",
    "Running algorithms that require a lot of computation (e.g., machine learning training).\n",
    "- Performance Impact: Since CPU-bound tasks require a lot of CPU power, adding more CPU cores or processors can improve performance. These tasks are not affected by disk or network speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I/O-bound Tasks:\n",
    "- Definition: I/O-bound tasks are those that are primarily limited by input/output operations, such as reading from or writing to a disk, network requests, or waiting for data to come from an external source.\n",
    "- Examples: File reading or writing, Database queries, Network requests (e.g., downloading files from a server, making HTTP requests).\n",
    "- Performance Impact: I/O-bound tasks are typically slower due to the limitations of the I/O device (disk speed, network latency, etc.). These tasks benefit from parallelism because while one operation waits (e.g., reading data), the program can perform other I/O tasks or computations."

    "### Limitations of Single Thread:\n",
    "- Limited Performance: A single thread can only execute one task at a time, which means it cannot fully utilize the resources of multi-core processors. This leads to inefficient use of CPU power, especially for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "- Blocking Operations: If the thread encounters a blocking operation (e.g., waiting for I/O), the entire application is stalled. The thread will remain idle while waiting for the operation to complete, preventing other tasks from executing concurrently.\n",
    "- Poor Scalability: Single-threaded applications struggle to scale with the increasing number of cores or processors. As the workload increases, the system's performance may degrade due to the inability to parallelize tasks effectively.\n",
    "- Responsiveness Issues: In UI applications, if a long-running task is executed on the main thread, it may cause the application to freeze or become unresponsive, leading to a poor user experience.\n",
    "- Inefficient Handling of I/O-bound Tasks: For applications that need to handle many I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading files or making network requests), a single-threaded design can result in inefficiencies, as the thread will wait idly during each I/O operation instead of performing other tasks.\n"

    "## Multi-Threading:\n",
    "- Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads (smaller units of a process) are executed concurrently within a single process. Each thread runs independently but shares the same memory space, allowing for efficient use of resources, such as CPU time and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of a CPU's execution. It is a part of a process, and multiple threads can exist within the same process.\n",
    "- Concurrency: In multithreading, threads appear to run concurrently, even on a single-core processor. However, true parallel execution happens only when multiple cores are available.\n",
    "- Shared Resources: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which makes communication between them faster compared to processes that do not share memory.\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "- Improved Efficiency: Multithreading helps in improving the performance of programs by utilizing CPU time more effectively, especially for tasks that can be done concurrently (e.g., downloading files while processing data).\n",
    "- Asynchronous Operations: It is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, where threads can continue executing while waiting for external operations (like disk or network I/O) to complete.\n"
